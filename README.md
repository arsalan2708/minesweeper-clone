# Minesweeper clone
Made just for fun as a personal project.
For every round random number(5 - 100) mines are randomly assigned to the field.
You loose the game if you pick the block with the mine.

# How To Play:
Left-Click to select the block on the grid
Right-Click to mark the spot on the grid for potential mines.
